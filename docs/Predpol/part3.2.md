### The predictive policing system affects the public's attitude to policing. 

Trustworthy. Public view a policing decision is less trustworthy. Lee (2018) found that when the decision-maker (either algorithmic or human) was making a decision about a mechanical task (for example scheduling employees’ shift patterns), algorithm and human-made decisions were perceived as equally fair and trustworthy. However, differences appeared when the decision-maker was considering a human task (for example who is more likely to commit a crime); here, algorithms were perceived as less fair and trustworthy and evoked more negative emotions than human decisions. People seem to think that algorithms lack intuition and subjective judgement capabilities (Lee, 2018). Therefore, the more police rely solely on algorithmic decision-making, the less trusting people may be in decisions.

And trustworthiness cannot be established between general public and policing predictive algorithms: first, the public cannot feel a personal connection to the algorithms; and second, nowadays the algorithms are not transparent or comprehensible to the general public. For example, after two years of litigation, the public only got piecemeal production from the NYPD. All of the above make the general public think police decisions are less trustworthy than before. 
Procedural justices. Public focuses more on procedural justice. Public are more likely to believe that a procedure is legitimate if they can participate in the process and express their views to the decision-maker. Studies have shown that individuals value this ability to participate even if their participation has no ability to affect the outcome of the procedure. However, after using policing predictive systems, the public knows that the ultimate decision has effectively already been made by the algorithms before their participation. In fact, the public has no chance for real participation in the predictive process. The absence makes the public less likely to believe that the procedure is legitimate. Therefore, the public pays more attention to procedural justices.

And the fact that the application of predictive policing systems is derived from historical data with biases, also undermines people’s sense that the police act impartially. The uncertainty and opaque pf policing procedure raise public’s awareness on procedural justices.
