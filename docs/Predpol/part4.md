**Opinions**

- PredPol predictions target POC neighborhoods, replicating entrenched racial disparities in policing.  A pleasure to work on this killer story! 
——Annie Gilbertson, Journalist+Audio Producer+Editor.

- PredPol had a good record of predicting where crimes are likely to take place. What is more challenging is to show that we have been able to reduce crime with that information.—— John Phillips, Kent’s superintendent.

- “Critics have warned that PredPol and other ... predictive policing tools could reinforce and “tech-wash” bias in policing”. See this critique a lot. It’s never attributed because it’s never from anyone who knows how PP works. Always just “critics”  —— Jerry Ratcliffe, Host of Reducing Crime podcast.

- This article methodology (Crime Prediction Software Promised to Be Free of Biases) is tailored to a desired conclusion. Rather than doing something interesting with these data, the Markup team did a dull analysis to get exactly what they wanted, then use it to argue PredPol is racist. It's lazy ideology and we should call it that. —— Charles Fain Lehman

- The ultimate issue is what did officer do prior to PredPol and what are they doing now? My best guess is that bias is likely reduced with some form of data-driven policing compared to letting them decide themselves, but implementation matters. —— Dennis Mares, Criminal Justice Professor at SIUE
