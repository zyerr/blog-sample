## What is Predpol?

- Predictive policing: Forecasting crime with big data. It is a way to use computer systems to analyze large sets of data, including historical crime data, to predict and help prevent potential future crimes.As of 2020, PredPol's algorithm is the most commonly used predictive policing algorithm in the U.S. It shows where the computer predicts crimes will happen in the future(“Wikipedia”,2021).

- PredPol uses a machine-learning algorithm to calculate predictions. Historical event datasets are used to train the algorithm for each new city (ideally 2 to 5 years of data). PredPol then updates the algorithm each day with new events as they are received from the department.3 data points – crime type, crime location and crime date/time- are used in prediction calculation(“Predpol.com”,2021).
