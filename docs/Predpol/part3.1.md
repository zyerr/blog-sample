title: How does PredPol affect our mind?

We may wonder whether there’s an impartial algorithm that can guide us into a more transcendent society, within which we can break free from our cursed history of never-ending distrust and oppression? In the case of PredPol, the answer is pessimistic: people find that the algorithmic governance approaches such as PredPol are increasingly strengthen our original bias in a vicious cycle: the algorithm makes discriminative judgement based on human-biased data, and human executive act with algorithm-biased instruction. Instead of making detached judgement, the algorithm is repeating our mistakes.

However, compared to the continuation of discrimination in policing systems, the camouflage of discrimination in the jurisdiction process is more disconcerting and worth our concern. It seems that the algorithm is helping us to make judgement and reasonable distribution of police force, the overreliance on technology distracts our attention from the harder and more important parts of the process, the parts that relies on imagination and human judgement (Manuel, 2017). In this way, we are confronted one of the fundamental conflicts in this case: the difference and tension between objectivity and subjectivity. It seems that our eternal pursuits of objectivity, the most reasonable distribution of police force based on the accurate prediction of future crime rate, ends with subjectivity, the stubborn and unconscious bias hidden in our culture and blood. The interference of algorithmic policing is blurring the boundary between scientific method, the jurisdiction practice, and the blind belief in the “objective” machine systems. Although the human judgement is still the most important part in policing, the automation bias can set in and convince the human operators that the machine knows better than they do, which justifies the once improper values by hiding them in the systematic bias of algorithm.

Furthermore, the PredPol system can also be considered as a mixture of a new fatalism and a development of surveillance society. According to the fatalism, everything in the future can be foreseen and determined. If we try to interpret our case in this view, we can find that in PredPol case, we are trying to predict something in the future and stop it ahead of time. However, this may also lead to a rebellion to the predicted fate, which indicates the switch in the pattern of crimes, making the criminals change their behavior from staying in a territory to continuously moving between communities. This can also be further confirmed in the surveillance theory. According to Foucault, the panopticon is the system that makes the individuals inside feels as if they are continuously scrutinized, so that they will always behave as if they were in front of someone, leading to the transaction of behavior. In PredPol case, the authority is carrying out surveillance, in which the granularity of surveillance has transacted from individual to communities, to shock the criminals in a large area with relatively little devotions. This is effective, since the criminals will find that the police force seems to be everywhere. Meanwhile, this may lead to the transaction in their behavior pattern, just as the prisoners in the panopticon do. While it can lead to the surrender to the justice, it can also result in a trickier way of running-around committing tendency. Also, the communities that are considered the objectives of the surveillance will also go through a transaction, mainly reflecting by the atmosphere of the uncertain changing in patrolling policeman.
